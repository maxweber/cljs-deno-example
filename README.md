# ClojureScript Deno example

A "Hello, world" HTTP server example running ClojureScript on Deno.

## Running

```shell
yarn start
```

This will compile the ClojureScript into an ECMAScript module and load it in Deno. Visit http://localhost:8080 for a warm greeting.

Hot reloading does _not_ work, so you'll have to restart it manually after each change.
